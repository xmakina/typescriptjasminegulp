# Jasmine Typescript Gulp Automated Testing

Want to use Typescript, Jasmine and Gulp all at once? Same.

Can't find a single damn tutorial or working example for it? Fixed.

  - Everything in Typescript (except gulpfile.js)
  - Uses gulp-typescript to enable rapid compiling during watch
  - Compiles and tests as you code

This is just a sample app to get you going. If I get someone interested, I'll write a blog explaining it all.

### Installation
```
npm install
```
````
gulp watch
````
